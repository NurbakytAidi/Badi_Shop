Hello
the project is called “Badi-shop”
the name of this store is also “Badi-shop”
What libraries did I use?
What libraries did I use?
1* React , React-router-dom
2*Clsx
I did not use 3 axios, since it is not practical, I myself manually wrote it in a separate file, and applied it
4* used the API at fakesstorespi.com.

1*I will briefly tell you what I did, 2*what were the difficulties, 3*of course, what are the differences
1. when you enter the site, there is a main page about us,
at the bottom there are such functions as (what products are there, product search, clothes search, also a basket "
2. for me there were such difficulties as “registration” and it took a lot of time, Backend should have been used
The second difficulty is testing the function, I read various documentations, found out which libraries are “React-testing-library” and there is also “jest”, I did not have enough time to write testing, in the future I will go deeper, learn and start writing testing
3* I added a basket from myself, where you can see the product, the amount of the product, if you click on a couple of products and look at the basket, then the sum of all the products will be displayed there.
There is more detailed information about the product ..

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
